title: "Automatic Analysis of Closed-Source Mobile Apps to support Software Engineering Tasks"
description: "The amount of android applications is having a tremendous increasing trend, leading the mobile software market to exert pressure over practitioners and researchers about several topics like application quality, frequent releases, and quick fixing of bugs. Because of this, mobile app development process requires of improving the release cycles. Therefore, the automation of software engineering tasks has become a top research topic. As a result of this research interest, several automated approaches have been proposed to support software engineering tasks. Specifically for this research we explore the possibility of performing automated software engineering tasks using APKs as entry instead of source code."
