title: Eventual Connectivity issues in Android Apps
description: |
  Study on "Eventual Connectivity" Issues exhibited by Android apps in-the-wild. By manually executing and inspecting 50 open source Android apps we build a catalog of (i) bad practices/issues, and (ii) hybrid practices that are exhibited dynamically by Android apps and could affect users perceived quality. The execution was based on 986 scenarios we designed (in total) for the 50 apps. We found 316 instances of 10 categories of "eventual connectivity" issues (which account for an average of 6.32 issues per app), and 4 instances of two categories of hybrid practices.
