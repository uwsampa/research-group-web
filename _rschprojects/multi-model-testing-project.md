title: Multi Model Testing of Android Apps
description: Models based testing enables software developers to derive abstract tests from a system representation. Inherently, mobile applications have multiple models that represent them, such as the domain model, usage model, GUI model or context model. Different models condense different but complementary information that can be mixed into a single and enriched multi-model. Taking advantage of the flexibility the Android Platform gives to developers it is possible to programatically and automatically extract these models from dynamic and static analyses of an application's source code. Eventually, a complete test suite can be generated from the multi-model, which includes as many factors as the input models have.
