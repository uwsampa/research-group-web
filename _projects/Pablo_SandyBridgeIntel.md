title: Analysis of graphics performance for SandyBridge Intel-Processor

description: Sandy brige is the name given to the architecture used in the intelligent processors of second generation developed by Intel. The main characteristic is the integration of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) in the same die of the Central Processing Unit (CPU) which enables to perform graphic processing without the need of using an external discrete graphic card. This also gives adventages in terms of performace, such as the Intel Quick Sync technology which carries out a quick transcoding of high resolution videos.
