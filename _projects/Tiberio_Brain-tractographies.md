title: Method of extrapolation of anatomical context sensitive interest regions for subject cohortes analysis in brain tractographies

description: The study of the brain is becoming a focus of interest using computers in order to obtain new information and prepare standard calculations valuable for doctors. In this project, a new algorithm was made  for BRAVIZ () for extrapolating regions of interest that depends on anatomical context for the analysis of brain tractografies. This new algorithm uses linear interpolation methods in order to reduce the distance from the calculated regions against a region set by an expert in brain research.
