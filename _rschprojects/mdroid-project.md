title: "MDroid+: Enabling Mutation Testing for Android Apps"
description: This project was created by the Software Engineering Maintenance and Evolution Research Unit (SEMERU) at the College of William & Mary, in collaboration with Universidad de los Andes, The University of Sannio, and The University of Lugano.  The major goal of the MDroid+ project is to help mobile application developers and testers improve the quality of their test suites. This project empirically derived a set of 38 Android-specific mutation operators which can be automatically seeded into a target application and analyzed on a set of test cases.
