title: Agent-based urban segregation model and visualization proposal

description: This project presents a model for urban segregation based on three different agents, those are, householders, investors and promoters. Using a simple visualization tool, it is possible to interact with the steps of the simulation from the model. This proposal creates an interaction of an artificial intelligence tool and an economic simulation in a spatial context. The model was validated following steps of previous models presented along with an expert in urban planning. This is considered a first proposal that allows the urban planner to understand the systematic behavior of the agents under an economic and spatial context.
