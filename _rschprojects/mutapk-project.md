title: "MutAPK: Mutation Testing for Android Applications using APK files"
description: "Mutation testing for Android Applications using APK files instead of Source Code. This project uses a set of 38 Android-specific mutation operators defined by MDroid+ project which can be automatically seeded into a target application and analyzed on a set of test cases.
