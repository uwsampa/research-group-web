title: Accelerated solution of microkinetic differential equations

description: |
  Leveraging the advanced numerical techniques implemented in the Julia programming language, we are developing customized solutions to dramatically speed up the solutions of the challenging stiff differential algebraic equations (DAE’s) that describe the interactions of chemical species on catalytic surfaces.
